# Proximity Sensor Dashboard

This project is an industrial-style safety system using an ultrasonic sensor with Arduino, a real-time Python dashboard, and Google Sheets logging. The dashboard shows live distance data, changes color based on safety thresholds, and logs everything both locally and online.
